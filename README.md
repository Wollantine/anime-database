# typescript-react-redux-saga-boilerplate

A simple SPA boilerplate intended for test projects, katas and prototypes. **Not production ready**.

It includes:

- Typescript (via @babel/preset-typescript + tsc)
- React
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Styles with Fela!
- Ramda and other interesting stuff

## Usage

Clone the project, `npm i` it, and start the project with:

```
npm start
```

Test it:

```
npm test
```

And typecheck it:

```
npm run typecheck
```

It will also run `test && typecheck` automatically before commit, thanks to Husky.
